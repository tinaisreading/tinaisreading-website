        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm Tina Ollenburg. I love books. I mainly read contemporary fiction, but I'm challenging myself to read at least one nonfiction book a month and one book published more than twenty years ago. I think it's important to push yourself to read things you normally wouldn't. I shadowed Michiko Kakutani on another blog "I Want Michiko's Job," reading and reviewing every one of her book selections for one year. It was definitely a challenge (especially when I didn't care for the book), but it also broadened my reading horizons.</p>
        <p> When I'm not reading, I try to work on my fiction writing. I also perform improv comedy in Charlotte, NC with Improv Charlotte and The Know It Alls. I've just started learning front end web development, so this site is also a place for me to hone those skills. I love my husband, my dog, and an awesome cheese plate with a great glass of wine!</p>
